# Ecology-Explorer :
This is the EDA Notebook and map prototypes for a desktop / web based map production software. It reads in geometries of U.S. states and U.S. ecologies and given a prompt of a state name, creates a large context map of the entire ecologies that touch the state, and a state focused map with ecologies clipped at state boundaries, for any state in the contiguous United States.
