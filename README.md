# Ecology-Explorer
This is the EDA Notebook and map prototypes for a desktop / web based map production software. It reads in geometries of the U.S. state and U.S. ecologies within that stare, given user input of a State name. Creates a large context map of the entire ecologies that touch the state, a state focused map with ecologies clipped at state boundaries, and an HTML glossary of terms for any state in the contiguous United States.
