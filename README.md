# Ecology-Explorer :
This is the EDA Notebook and map prototypes for a desktop / web based map production software. It reads in geometries of U.S. states and U.S. ecologies and given a prompt of a state name, creates a large context map and a state oriented map for any State in the contiguous United States.
